In this assignment, you'll only have to fill in buf.h and buf.C. 
buf.h contains specifications for the class BufMgr. Please read it before you start.

main.C, test_driver.C, BMTester.C are testing programs. You don't need to modify them.

Use Makefile to compile your project. Type 'make' to compile, 'make run' to run (output is shown in the file 'my_output'), 
and 'make clean' to delete the files generated by Makefile.

You can compare your ouput with sample_output.
